# Model Deployment for Credit Card Fraud Detection

This is the github repo implement the model deployment from the data hackathon I participated.
In Summary, I have built the predictive model based on XGBoost ML Algorithm. 
It used to predict the credit card transaction validity.
Besides, I have integrated into API by using Flask microframework and deploy the API into Heroku (PaaS).
